Printable generator

Rechnenrucksack is an online printable task generator for primary school aged children. Parents and educators are welcome to use it: the program generates a printable treasure map with several randomly placed stones, and a number of arithmetic equations, that a child should solve, count the steps on the map in the given direction and find out where exactly had the pirates buried the treasure. The number and complexity of equations may be altered, according to the level of the child. Each map is different, so you can generate enough varied tasks for the whole class. The site has russian, english and german localizations.
